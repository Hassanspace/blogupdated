      <h1>Heaven for Bloggers - Sample Article</h1>
      <p>
        A blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is an informational website
        consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts).
        Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the
        most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. In the
        2000s, blogs were often the work of a single individual, occasionally of
        a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the
        2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of
        multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from
        newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy
        groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of
        blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems
        helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. Blog
        can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a
        blog. The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with
        the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of
        content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with
        HTML or computer programming. Previously, knowledge of such technologies
        as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content
        on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and
        computer enthusiasts. As of the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web
        2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this
        interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[2] In
        that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service.
        Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but
        also often build social relations with their readers and other
        bloggers.[3] Blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online
        comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content. There are
        also high-readership blogs which do not allow comments. Many blogs
        provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from
        philosophy, religion, and arts to science, politics, and sports. Others
        function as more personal online diaries or online brand advertising of
        a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text,
        digital images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media
        related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some
        focus on art (art blogs), photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs
        or vlogs), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). In education, blogs
        can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as
        edublogs. Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very
        short posts. Blog and blogging are now loosely used for content creation
        and sharing on social media, especially when the content is long-form
        and one creates and shares content on regular basis, so one could be
        maintaining a blog on Facebook or blogging on Instagram. A 2022 estimate
        suggested that there were over 600 million public blogs out of more than
        1.9 billion websites.[4]
